# Roam

An alternative approach to allocate OAM within Super Mario World, retaining the
benefits of the popular "No More Sprite Tile Limits" patch while offering much
better performance.

This is an experimental patch and it has not been tested thoroughly.

## Notes

To enable custom sprite support, change the define accordingly. Note that this
patch requires you to specify the size of each sprite in the tables located near
the bottom of the patch.
